# Desk Clock Lite for Android

</div>

This is my second Android program written in Java!

This software was written to utilize old phones. The software is forward compatible up to Android 2.3, but may also be compatible with Android 2.2, so you can install it on almost any of your Android devices (provided your device supports installation of third-party software).

Some of the code may not be implemented as well as it should be. Hopefully you can correct me on some of these within issues.
